 * WHY THE FONTS ARE IN THE REPOSITORY RATHER THAN FETCHED BY next/font/google.
 *
 * `next/font/google` self-hosts the files, but it downloads them DURING THE
 * BUILD. That puts fonts.googleapis.com on the critical path of
 * `docker build` — so a transient failure at Google fails the image build
 * with "An error occurred in `next/font`" while nothing about the
 * application is wrong.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. On 2026-09-26 it failed business-os CI on a
 * commit that changed one SVG path, and then failed that deploy on the
 * server minutes later; both went green on a retry that changed nothing. A
 * deploy somebody else's CDN can break is not a deploy we control.
 *
 * Run this only to add a face, a weight or an axis. Nothing in the build
 * calls it.

 *
 * ── VARIABLE FAMILIES ARE ONE FILE, NOT ONE PER WEIGHT ─────────────────────
 *
 * Google's css2 API emits a separate @font-face per requested weight even
 * when the family is variable — and for a variable family all of those
 * blocks point at the SAME woff2. Saving one copy per weight writes
 * byte-identical files and makes the browser fetch the same font several
 * times under several hashed names, because nothing downstream knows they
 * are the same.
 *
 * So downloads are deduplicated by URL. A family whose weights collapse to
 * one file is written once as `<family>-variable.woff2` and declared with a
 * weight RANGE; a family with distinct URLs keeps one file per weight.
 *
 * ── AXES ARE NOT OPTIONAL EXTRAS, THEY CHANGE WHICH FILE YOU GET ───────────
 *
 * Asking for `Fraunces:wght@100..900` returns a 36 KB file. Asking for
 * `Fraunces:opsz,wght,SOFT,WONK@...` returns a different, 121 KB file that
 * actually carries the design space. Vendor the first and every
 * `font-variation-settings` in the stylesheet silently does nothing.
 *
 * Axis names go in the query lowercase-alphabetical first, then
 * uppercase-alphabetical — that is the API's rule, and getting it wrong is a
 * 400 rather than a wrong file, which is at least loud.
 *
 * LICENSING. Every family here is under the SIL Open Font License, which
 * permits redistribution including bundled in an application, and requires
 * the licence travel with the files. The `*-OFL.txt` files are the upstream
 * texts, unmodified, and must not be deleted.
